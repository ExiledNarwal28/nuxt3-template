# TODO

Not writing issues at the moment, obviously still pretty in a WIP-state.

Features

- Add basic pages and components
- Link Planets API

Docs

- Add golden rules
- Add doc for each common component

DevEx

- Add jest unit tests
- Add storybook

One day

- Create more generic template for any programming project (with docs, maybe some golden rules?)
- Create more generic template for any TS project (with docs!)
- Move eslint and prettier configs to a separate repo (+ add inheritance for TS and various frameworks)
- Create an API to be used here (would provider good GQL mutation examples)
